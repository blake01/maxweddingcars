{% block description %}
<p>Our Vintage Style Tourers represent the ultimate in Wedding transport. Finished in old English white with cream leather interiors, these cars will provide a superb
backdrop to your Wedding photographs. Enjoy the experience of travelling in style in these elegant vehicles. Should the weather be unkind, these cars have soft top hoods (see pictures) to 
protect you from the elements at any time of year. </p>
<p>Our Tourers are four door &lsquo;long bodied&rsquo; versions of the marque, affording greater rear space for your comfort.</p>
<p>See our Mercedes Benz Limousine if you require additional transport for several Bridesmaids.</p>
